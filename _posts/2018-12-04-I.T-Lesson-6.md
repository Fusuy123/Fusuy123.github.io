**I.T Lesson 6**

Today was a very basic lesson; we all walked in and immediately started off with our binary coders and decoders. I found our work quite tricky but managed it all in the end. I had a bit of trouble with my vlookup but after I asked a few of my peers, I was able to complete the task. Still no luck on the github background :(
