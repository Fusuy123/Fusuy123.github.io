**I.T Lesson 7**

Today was a bit of a strange lesson. We had a cover today instead of Mr Tansley so he set up an interesting task on classroom where we gave us a long binary message to decode. We had to make a binary decoder in addition to our binary coders. It was quite tricky but I got the hang of it soon. The message read something like 'This message is far is far too long to write out in full- Bett'. I canâ€™t remember what it said exactly but it said something like that. After we finished, we were allowed to play lightbot for the remainder of the lesson. It was really easy in the start but became nearly impossible by the end. Still no luck on the background :(
