    <td>I was ready for the lesson and was all prepared and was diligently paying attention to every word Mr Tansley said, however, I was quite puzzled when he started to explain the code and why it worked. It might be as I wasn't here in Year 7 when they learnt how to understand code or if I just am a bit slow with I.T.</td>
