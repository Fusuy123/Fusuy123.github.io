**I.T Lesson 8**

Today was the lesson when we were finally ⅔ of the way through the year so it was time to swap teachers. We blessed and given Mr Keen and are set to learn python further. Our first lesson together of the year was a slightly unorthodox I.T Lesson but was really effective. We had to write instructions for making tea as if we were talking to aliens. Our group kind of got it but I'm sure we messed up. This exercise taught us that computers are like aliens and do exactly what you tell them to do and can’t infer and improvise humans can do naturally.
