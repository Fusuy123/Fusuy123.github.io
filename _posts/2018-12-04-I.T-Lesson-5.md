**I.T Lesson 5**

Today is our first day back from half term! We got straight into learning about basic binary. We also learnt that we could use 8-bit binary to create the keyboard we use to type with as it has 256 different combinations of on's and off’s. We also started to learn how to create a coder and decoder using binary and not shift this time. I started making the system on google sheets but haven’t finished as we spent most the lesson trying to get the gist of binary. I have also started using a different format for my blog but right now my background is white despite me trying to fix it. Must figure out soon
