    <td>What did I learn?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We learnt how to make it easier to input codes and get answers out of them quicker than before by using less code to input, however, I had a major error where when putting in my vlookup it would clear the whole sheet. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I did get confused sometimes but I saw what the person next to me was doing which helped improve my understanding. I really don't know how the code cleared my whole sheet and I did not reach a resolution before the end of the lesson. I will try harder and try all the possibilities to fix one of my problems.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to ask more questions from Mr Tansley to see if I have made mistakes and how I can improve them and to see if I can get a further explanation of something.</td>
